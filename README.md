The following analysis was conducted to help build a classifier capabale of effectively determining and classifying the fetal health of a newly-born baby using the following variables:

- Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)

- accelerations: Number of accelerations per second

- fetal_movement: Number of fetal movements per second

- uterine_contractions: Number of uterine contractions per second

- light_decelerations: Number of LDs per second

- severe_decelerations: Number of SDs per second

- prolongued_decelerations: Number of PDs per second

- abnormal_short_term_variability: Percentage of time with abnormal short term variability
